At the end of the year, we take suggestions for Extra Topics; each year there are a few that are important but not quite enough for a full lecture. So, now, we'll cover a few of those:

* Working with PHI
  * Why I wrote / use [projectr](https://github.com/jeff-goldsmith/projectr)
* [here::here()](https://here.r-lib.org) and a [discussion](https://github.com/jennybc/here_here) of why it's great
* Traditional statistical methods (or why everything is just regression)
* LLMs in data science

We'll revisit some examples from the course, and also take a look at the data in this [zip file](data/jury_data.zip) (described [here](https://github.com/APM-Reports/jury-data)).
